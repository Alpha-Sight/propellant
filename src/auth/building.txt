# Next Step: Implement contract.rs

The most logical next step is to implement the `contract.rs` file, which contains the core logic of your smart contract.

Here's the recommended development sequence:

1. **contract.rs** ← We are here
   - Implement the instantiate function
   - Implement execute message handlers for user registration
   - Implement query handlers for user lookups

2. **error.rs** (after contract.rs)
   - Define custom error types for the contract

3. **lib.rs** (after error.rs)
   - Export all modules and register entry points

4. **Unit tests** (alongside development)
   - Test each function in isolation

5. **Integration tests** (after basic functionality works)
   - Test the contract as a whole
   - Mock the Burnt wallet integration

Let me know if you'd like me to provide the implementation for `contract.rs` now, or if you prefer to tackle this in a different order.

Missing Components
CV Request Verification and Hash Signature Generation

There's no function to verify CV requests and generate a signed token/hash
No event emission for approved CV requests
JWT Verification

The JWT verification functionality is commented out (execute_verify_jwt)
You need proper cryptographic verification between frontend and backend
Monthly Reset Mechanism for Free Tier

The free tier is set up but doesn't enforce the "2 requests monthly" limit
No time-based tracking for monthly usage reset
Hash-Based CV Verification Workflow

Missing the flow where a hash is generated, verified, and used for backend authorization
Here's what I would add to implement your requirements:


missing_components.rs
// 1. Add to ExecuteMsg enum:
ExecuteMsg::RequestCvGeneration {} => execute_request_cv_generation(deps, env, info),
ExecuteMsg::VerifyHash { user_address, hash_signature } => execute_verify_hash(deps, env, info, user_address, hash_signature),

// 2. Implement CV request verification and hash generation
Additional Configuration Needed:
UserSubscription Struct:

Add last_reset_time field to track when monthly counters reset
JWT Implementation:

Uncomment and properly implement the JWT verification
Config Updates:

Add a backend integration address to the config
Error Handling:

Add specific errors for the CV generation flow
State Management:

Add PENDING_CV_REQUESTS Map to track request hashes
The workflow I've implemented follows your outline:

User is registered with Abstraxion and placed in free tier with 2 monthly requests
When making a CV request, frontend calls RequestCvGeneration
Contract checks tier and limits, generates a hash signature and emits an event
Backend uses VerifyHash to validate the request using JWT+address
If valid, contract records usage and authorizes CV generation
This implementation adds the missing pieces to create the secure verification flow you described.
